# non_interactorakis
A Command Line file editor

Project inspired by http://shadow-file.blogspot.gr/2009/01/how-to-sudoedit-non-interactively.html, and https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/37710/ .
Using this technique you can sudoedit remotely (using a semi non-interactive shell) any file the /etc/sudoers allows.
